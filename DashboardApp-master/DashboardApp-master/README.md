This project is used throughout the Pluralsight course <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/modernizing-websites-microsoft-azure">Modernizing Your Websites with Azure Platform as a Service</a>.

What's it all about?

"The Cloud" is an increasingly attractive proposition for hosting websites online, and Microsoft Azure is an absolute standout. Their "platform as a service" offerings for both websites and databases offer fantastic features, massive scalability, and attractive pricing. But how will you migrate your sites? What will it cost? And how about security? This course answers those questions and paves the way to move from traditional hosting and into Microsoft's cloud.
